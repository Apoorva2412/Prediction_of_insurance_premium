# Prediction_of_insurance_premium
Using Regression algorithms (Machine Learning) predicted the insurance premium of the customers.
Initial exploratory data analysis is performed on the data.
Machine learning algorithms like Logisitc Regression (univariate, Bi-variate and multivariate), Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor are used for predictions
Finally metrics are compared for all the models to find the best possible model for prediction of insurance premium
